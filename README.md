paper: ***Few-shot Multi-domain Text Intent Classification with Dynamic Balance Domain Adaptation Meta-learning***
## InDs-CoV
In this paper, we provide a manually annotated Chinese dataset InDs-CoV. It is the first Chinese intent classification dataset of the personal views and needs truly expressed by users on social media related to COVID-19, which is of great research significance.  

We collected user-posted Weibo related to the COVID-19 outbreak from January 1 to June 30, 2020, a critical times period. All data in our dataset is obtained from social media platforms in formal methods and in strict compliance with the platform's data security policies.  

We selected 10,100 representative data for annotation from a large amount of data. The constructed InDs-CoV dataset contains a total of 81 intent categories from multiple domains.
